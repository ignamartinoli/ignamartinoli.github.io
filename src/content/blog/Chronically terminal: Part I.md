Over the past few years, I’ve found myself slowly leaving behind the familiar, mouse-driven interfaces I’ve relied on for years.
At first, it felt strange—almost like stepping into a different world.
But what started as a small experiment soon turned into a complete workflow transformation.

I discovered a set of tools that didn’t just replicate what I was used to—they reimagined it.
My days became faster, more focused, and strangely more enjoyable.
Tasks that used to feel cumbersome suddenly felt effortless, all without leaving the keyboard.

In this post, I’m going to take you through this journey, exploring how these unexpected replacements have completely changed the way I work—and why embracing them might be the productivity boost you didn’t know you needed.

## Alt intro

In the recent years, during my Linux usage, I stumbled upon different tools that made me realize how little need I had for a proper GUI.

The terminal is the natural habitat of a programmer.
