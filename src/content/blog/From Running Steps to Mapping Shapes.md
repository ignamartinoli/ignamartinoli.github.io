Yes — that idea comes from the concept of **linguistic relativity** (the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis) but applied to programming languages.

## Introduction

## Polymorphism

You may already know the concept of polymorphism from Object Oriented Programming, and while it's a cornerstone of that paradigm, it doesn't belong to that paradigm.

### Rank polymorphism

## Cue APL

### BQN

BQN is an APL dialect by Marshall Lockbaum that was designed with the objective.

## Problem in BQN

## Changed mind

```python
print({'LLNNNLL':'Argentina','LLLNLNN':'Brasil','LLNNNN':'Bolivia','LLLLNNN':'Paraguay','LLLNNNN':'Uruguay'}.get(''.join('L' if x.isalpha() else 'N' for x in input())))
```

Both capture the same point: the programming language you use doesn’t just let you express solutions — it also **shapes how you conceive problems and what solutions you even notice are possible**.
